    <h2>Introduction & Vision</h2>
    <p>
      QuantumPepe combines viral meme culture with cutting-edge blockchain technology to enable a transparent and dynamic presale. Our vision is to create an ecosystem where technology and community converge.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      By implementing dynamic pricing and robust security measures, QuantumPepe builds transparency and trust during the presale process. Our solution addresses market volatility and fosters long-term community engagement.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Technological Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The platform features a responsive frontend with MetaMask integration and a smart contract that implements the presale mechanism, including phased price increases. This ensures both usability and security.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Tokenomics & Distribution</h2>
    <p>
      Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000 QPEPE<br>
      Distribution:
      <ul>
        <li>29% Presale</li>
        <li>30% Liquidity Pool</li>
        <li>25% Staking/Rewards</li>
        <li> 10% Reserved</li>
        <li>  6% Team</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Smart-Contract</h2>
    <p>
     The contract is structured in such a way that all tokens remain in the contract except for the 6% for the team, which goes to the team wallet. The liquidity from the presales is also fixed in the contract with 85% going into liquidity and cannot be moved. The remaining 15% is for further development to drive the project forward. Everything is firmly anchored in the contract. We attach great importance to transparency.

    <p> 
    <h2>Staking with 20% for 1 year</h2>
    <p>
      The staking is set up with 20% rewards per year, but this will only be activated later. The staking runs for a maximum of 1 year or until the pool is empty, but it is quite possible that the claiming will be released earlier, this depends on many factors.
     <p> 
    <h2>Roadmap & Development</h2>
    <p>
      Our multi-phase development plan starts with the presale, followed by DEX integrations, and culminates with CEX listings and international expansion. Continuous development and security updates are part of our long-term strategy.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Security & Audits</h2>
    <p>
      We employ proven OpenZeppelin standards, reliable price feeds, and regular external audits to ensure maximum security. Bug bounty programs further help in maintaining the integrity of the platform.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Mechanisms</h2>
    <p>
      No fees, just a function to maybe burn a few tokens later.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      QuantumPepe sets new standards by merging meme culture with innovative blockchain technologyâ€”transparent, secure, and future-oriented.
